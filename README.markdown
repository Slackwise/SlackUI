SlackUI
=========
Contrasting TukUI / ElvUI, I am creating a project to update the UI holistically,
but I will be using Blizzard's textures and aesthetics rather than redesigning everything,
making only minor tweaks adding the tiny features we all crave, all of them optional.

A true *minimalist* approach.

P.S. This project is still **PRE-ALPHA**  and mostly a collection of personal tweaks to the standard Blizzard UI.


Why is this on GitHub...?

For backup. Feel free to steal any of this code. :P
