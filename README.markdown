SlackwiseTweaks
===============
A collection of personal small tweaks and optional features to the default WoW UI.

Can I use this?
---------------
In its current state, much of this code is specific to my needs and anyone I've developed features for.
You're welcome to mess around with it.

Future Goals
------------
Ideally I modularize all features so they're checkbox options in the Options menu,
and I add UI elements to control the functionality for everyone else.

Questions?
----------
If you do have any questions, just contact me via GitHub.
